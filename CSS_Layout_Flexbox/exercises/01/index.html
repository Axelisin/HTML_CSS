                <h3>3rd Law</h3>
                <p>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or
                    Second Law</p>

            <p>Asimov later added another rule, known as the fourth or zeroth law, that superseded the others. It stated
                that <i>“a robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.”</i></p>
